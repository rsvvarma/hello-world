### Understanding Containers

# Three Important Things
Linux namespaces-> controls what you can see <br />
Changing root <br />
Control groups -> controls what you can use <br />

As of now what the code does is, it creates a new hostnamespace and what ever the changes to the hostnamespace inside wont effect the hostnamespace outside the container
